# Zama Recognition

**Built by:** Godspower Ufot  
**Stack:** Next.js (frontend), Zama blockchain (smart contracts), Ethers.js/Hardhat (deploy & tests)  
**Purpose:** A privacy-first recognition system for creators on the Zama blockchain. VIP nominators are encrypted so creators can see that they were nominated while protecting VIP identity to reduce online harassment.

## Project Overview

Zama Recognition is a blockchain-powered recognition system aimed at rewarding and recording creator achievements on the Zama chain. The key privacy-preserving innovation is that VIP nominators are **encrypted** before being recorded so creators can verify nominations while the VIPs' identities remain protected from public exposure, helping to reduce online harassment or targeted attacks.Watch the video here [Zama YT Video](https://youtu.be/asDzOauM9fI)
Creators can:

- Create and manage a profile
- See recognition history & stats
- Mint recognition records as NFTs
- Share recognition cards externally (e.g., on X)

VIPs can:

- Become a VIP (test flow available "Become VIP")
- Nominate creators with a reason (encrypted)
- Their nomination is recorded and can be verified by creators but not publicly exposed

---

## Core Features

- **VIP Encryption:** VIP addresses are encrypted before being stored; the system maintains verifiable recognition without exposing VIP identity.
- **Creator Profiles:** Creators create profiles and check their recognition stats and history.
- **Recognition NFTs:** Creators can mint recognized nominations as NFTs for provenance & sharing.
- **Dashboard:** Creator dashboard shows recognition history and aggregate stats (e.g., total recognitions, most frequent nominators â€” anonymized, top reasons, etc.).
- **Become VIP (test mode):** A testing flow to register as VIP (fhevm based) and verify nomination flows.
- **On-chain Storage:** Recognition records recorded to Zama blockchain contracts.
- **Admin / Future:** V2 will include more curated VIP-eligibility criteria.

---

## How It Works

1. **VIP Signup (Become VIP - test):**

   - VIP calls `becomeVIP()` (test) which encrypts their address and stores an encrypted VIP proof in `VIPRegistry`.
   - VIP can now nominate creators.

2. **Nomination:**

   - VIP nominates a creator using the UI â†’ UI encrypts VIP identity/address and submits nomination with `reason`.
   - Smart contract stores the nomination referencing an encrypted VIP token/identifier.

3. **Creator Actions:**

   - Creator logs in, views recognition history (pulls on-chain recognition records).
   - Creator may mint a recognition record as an NFT via `ZamaRecognitionMain`.

4. **Dashboard:**
   - Aggregates stats from `CreatorRegistry` and `ZamaRecognitionMain` to display outcomes.

## Security & Privacy

- Encrypted VIP addresses prevent harassment or retaliation.
- Only creators can see that they were nominated, without VIP exposure.
- On-chain recognition ensures transparency and immutability.

---

## Developer Notes & Contract Details

- **Frontend:** Next.js (with ethers.js integration).
- **Smart Contracts:** Hardhat + Zama blockchain environment.
- **Testing:** Hardhat tests cover VIP registration, creator recognition, and NFT minting.
- **Deployment:** See `contracts/deploy/deploy.ts` for deployment scripts.

---

## Future Work / V2 Wishlist

- Add **stricter VIP criteria** (community/governance validation).
- Recognition badges with **tiers/levels**.
- Creator leaderboard and **social graph integration**.
- Integration with **X (Twitter) API** for seamless sharing of recognition NFTs.

---

## VIP Criteria â€” Request to the Zama Body

Currently, anyone can become a VIP (testing purpose).
For V2, I propose that the Zama governing body help define:

- Minimum on-chain activity threshold
- Governance participation history
- Community contribution metrics
- Possible KYC/verification for high-tier VIPs

This will help ensure the system is credible and harder to game.
